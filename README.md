# Interactor with SQL

A facilitator for usage of psycopg2, PostgreSQL and potentially other SQL database.

**Purpose:** I wanted to make my work with PostgreSQL faster and smoother. Sometimes I need to save the data to SQL databases and this small application will help me to make this process quicker.

## Summary

### Technologies

Languages:

* Python
* SQL

Databases:

* PostgreSQL

Database adapters:

* psycopg2

Package manager:

* Virtualenv

### How it works

These are basically bunch of functions making the code shorter. It is still possible to user psycopg2 default database connection and cursor objects. It reads confidential database information from .env file
